                <p>Painter is a Legacy deck designed around the interaction between Painter's Servant and Grindstone. 
                </p>
                <p><em>As Painter’s Servant enters the battlefield, choose a color.
                <br>All cards that aren’t on the battlefield, spells, and permanents are the chosen color in addition to their other colors.</em></p>
                <p>
                    This simple text is groundbreaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic interaction with Grindstone is a single activation will mill your opponent's entire deck, leaving them to lose the next time they would draw a card. This two card combo costs only 6 mana, and all of it colorless. Further, the two peices can be played on turns 1 and 2, allowing you to win on turn 3. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because both peices are colorless artifacts, most Painter decks play some amount of fast mana and artifact synergies.

                <h2>What is Mono-Red Painter?</h2>
                <p>
                    All painter decks leverage the Painter + Grindstone combo, mono-red relies upon the copious synergies available in the color red, while embracing the simplicity that a mono-colored deck provides.

                <p>
                    There’s two mind bogglingly huge reasons to run red in Painter, they’re both so good I don’t know which to put first, so I’ll just start with the simplest:

                <p>
                    One Red, Instant: Counter target spell or destroy target permanent. It’s not hard to imagine how good this spell is. It’s hard to enumerate all the uses for such a flexible spell. Obviously you can use it to disrupt anything your opponent is doing or protect your stuff from their disruption, whichever feels pertinent at the time. But, nevertheless, here’s some tips.

                <h2>Why Splash Green?</h2>
                <p>
                    The green splash is primarily for one card, but it's a good one: Once Upon a Time (OuaT). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know if you noticed, but this deck plays a lot of creatures. Painter's Servent, the 4x our combo peice is a creature. And the Goblins that support him and find Grindstone are creatures. And our top end removal of Twinshot and Fury are creatures. Our plan B, Construct Beats, comes from a land, Urza's Saga. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To this end OuaT proves excellent card selection, helping fill out hands that are just have one thing missing, be it a land or a spell. And it does this for the cost of zero mana!? Beause we run Lotus Petal, Mox Opal, and treasures, it's usually not that hard to cast it if you draw it late game. And if you do happen to find yourself in the late game with no threats it is usually the best top deck you can hope for. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why not splash Green?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every since release of New Kamigawa, Painter has a new best card. And it's not a creature or a land. It's Fable of the Mirror Breaker.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Addittionally, OuaT is a spell you have to cast for 2 mana (sometimes anyways). Which makes it a very bad top deck vs opponents that are putting a lot of pressure on your life total and/or mana. Namely -- UR Delver. Delver can really put your deck to the test, and you can't really afford to take turn 2 off to play a spell that A) Doesn't advance your board state and B) might get Dazed. It can be difficult to find the mana to cast it at all after a wasteland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And Deler isn't the only Wasteland deck. Running fetchlands and Taigas over basic mountains opens you up to a lot of land hate that a mono-colored deck would otherwise be imune from.

                <h2>What is Mono-White Painter?</h2>
                <p>
                    People have apparently been playing mono-white decks involving the Painter combo in Legacy since as early as 2011, but it wasn’t until the introduction of Urza’s Saga in MH2 and a number of surprisingly efficient white artifact payoffs in AFR that the contemporary white Painter shell began to take shape. Otherwise known as Plumber or (if you’re really in the know) Kix, this unique Painter variant utilizes a low, aggressive curve of disruptive creatures and an expansive toolbox of artifacts to punish blue decks, set up and protect the Painter combo, and constrict the opponent’s plays while adding meaningfully to the board itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Key cards in white Painter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are examples of white-based Painter doing well with sol lands, but for the most part Plumber differentiates itself from red-based stompy variants by choosing instead to take advantage of Wasteland. In conjunction with Esper Sentinel, Ethersworn Canonist, Aether Vial, and the late game inevitability of Crucible of Worlds, Wasteland helps Plumber keep the opponent low on resources while inflicting serious damage with large Urza’s Saga constructs and card positive Ingenious Smiths. Smith, which can often feel like Tarmogoyf that draws a card on ETB, and the Birthing Pod-like Oswald Fiddlebender help the Plumber pilot find combo pieces and a variety of toolbox artifacts to keep opposing threats under control. Mother of Runes rounds out the creature suite, abusing its signature synergies with Wasteland, Aether Vial, and Canonist
