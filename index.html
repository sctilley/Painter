                All painter decks leverage the Painter + Grindstone combo, mono-red relies upon the copious synergies available in the color red, while embracing the simplicity that a mono-colored deck provides.

                There’s two mind bogglingly huge reasons to run red in Painter, they’re both so good I don’t know which to put first, so I’ll just start with the simplest:

            <h2>
                So Anyways I Start Blasting
            </h2>
            <p>
                One Red, Instant: Counter target spell or destroy target permanent. It’s not hard to imagine how good this spell is. It’s hard to enumerate all the uses for such a flexible spell. Obviously you can use it to disrupt anything your opponent is doing or protect your stuff from their disruption, whichever feels pertinent at the time. But, nevertheless, here’s some tips.

            <h2>What is Mono-White Painter?</h2>
            <p>
                People have apparently been playing mono-white decks involving the Painter combo in Legacy since as early as 2011, but it wasn’t until the introduction of Urza’s Saga in MH2 and a number of surprisingly efficient white artifact payoffs in AFR that the contemporary white Painter shell began to take shape. Otherwise known as Plumber or (if you’re really in the know) Kix, this unique Painter variant utilizes a low, aggressive curve of disruptive creatures and an expansive toolbox of artifacts to punish blue decks, set up and protect the Painter combo, and constrict the opponent’s plays while adding meaningfully to the board itself.

                Key cards in white Painter

            <p>
                There are examples of white-based Painter doing well with sol lands, but for the most part Plumber differentiates itself from red-based stompy variants by choosing instead to take advantage of Wasteland. In conjunction with Esper Sentinel, Ethersworn Canonist, Aether Vial, and the late game inevitability of Crucible of Worlds, Wasteland helps Plumber keep the opponent low on resources while inflicting serious damage with large Urza’s Saga constructs and card positive Ingenious Smiths. Smith, which can often feel like Tarmogoyf that draws a card on ETB, and the Birthing Pod-like Oswald Fiddlebender help the Plumber pilot find combo pieces and a variety of toolbox artifacts to keep opposing threats under control. Mother of Runes rounds out the creature suite, abusing its signature synergies with Wasteland, Aether Vial, and Canonist
